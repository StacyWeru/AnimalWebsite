                    <p>The image above  is <span>Green Monkey </span> , an American thoroughbred racehorse.<br>Why is he so darn expensive? Well, it has something to do with his incredible speed, running a mile in just under 9.8 seconds in his first ever race.He was also fathered by another thoroughbred American racehorse, Forestry.<br>So, a combination of his impressive speed and perfect genetics made him one of the most highly sort after horses in the equestrian world.He was auctioned for <em>$16 million </em>in 2009!</p>
