                           <p>The image above  is <span>Green Monkey </span> , an American thoroughbred racehorse.<br>Why is he so darn expensive? Well, it has something to do with his incredible speed, running a mile in just under 9.8 seconds in his first ever race.He was also fathered by another thoroughbred American racehorse, Forestry.<br>So, a combination of his impressive speed and perfect genetics made him one of the most highly sort after horses in the equestrian world.He was auctioned for <em>$16 million </em>in 2009!</p>

                           <p>Believe it or not,this tiny insect shown above is classified as one of the most dangeruos animals on earth right now according to an article published by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-deadliest-animals-2016-9?IR=T#8-ascaris-roundworms-4500-deaths-a-year-8"> Business Insider</a></p>
                            <p>Mosquitoes - the pesky bugs that suck blood and transmit viruses from person to person - are responsible for the most animal-related deaths.<br>Malaria by itself is responsible for more than half of mosquito-related deaths, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, though it's on the decline: The incidence of malaria fell by 37 percent between 2000 and 2015, according to the World Health Organisation.<br>
                             Dengue fever, another mosquito-borne disease, has become a leading cause of hospitalisation and death among children in some Asian and Latin-American countries.</p>
